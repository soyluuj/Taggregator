# Taggregator: Gamified Learning Website

Taggregator is a website that makes learning fun, by collecting a diverse
variety of articles and implementing gamified systems to encourage users to keep
learning. The website requires an account to use its services, and provides all
users with levels and XP points, reading streaks, achievements, and statistics.
The articles offered to the users can have one or more tags, such as "Science",
"Technology", "Nature", and can be combined for a diverse organization of
articles.
